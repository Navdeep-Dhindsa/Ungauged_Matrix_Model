# Ungauged_Matrix_Model
This folder contains a simple serial Monte Carlo Code used to generate configurations for different 1d models without gauge.
The code is motivated from the work [JHEP06(2018)124](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP06(2018)124), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02985](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02985) 

Comments:
>  Some autocorrelations in runs which can be improved by using HMC 

>  For eqns. of action, energy and other observables refer to  [JHEP05(2022)169](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)169), [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08791](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08791)
